        "\n",
        "This tutorial is based on the [YOLOv7 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) by WongKinYiu. This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to WongKinYiu and AlexeyAB for putting this repository together.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Steps Covered in this Tutorial**\n",
        "\n",
        "To train our detector we take the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Install YOLOv7 dependencies\n",
        "* Load custom dataset from Roboflow in YOLOv7 format\n",
        "* Run YOLOv7 training\n",
        "* Evaluate YOLOv7 performance\n",
        "* Run YOLOv7 inference on test images\n",
        "* OPTIONAL: Deployment\n",
        "* OPTIONAL: Active Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preparing a Custom Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will utilize an open source computer vision dataset from one of the 90,000+ available on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you already have your own images (and, optionally, annotations), you can convert your dataset using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), a set of tools developers use to build better computer vision models quickly and accurately. 100k+ developers use roboflow for (automatic) annotation, converting dataset formats (like to YOLOv7), training, deploying, and improving their datasets/models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow [the getting started guide here](https://docs.roboflow.com/quick-start) to create and prepare your own custom dataset."
